## Course Overview

**Catalog Description:** This course covers the theory and application of information visualization and of visual analytics, the science of combining interactive visual interfaces and information visualization techniques with automatic algorithms to support analytical reasoning through human-computer interaction. Research on visual perception, cognition, interactive visual interfaces, and visual analytics will be covered. Practical techniques for the display of complex multivariate data will be addressed. Course projects will require the development of interactive web-based interfaces to analyze and visualize real-world datasets. 

**Main Activities:** During the semester, students will develop interactive visualizations using [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/), read academic papers from [IEEE VIS](https://ieeevis.org/) and other top visualization conferences, give class presentations on current topics in information visualization and visual analytics, and gain hands-on experience in visualizing real-world datasets. 

**Prereq:** CS 625.  [What do I need to know coming into this course?](#prereq)
